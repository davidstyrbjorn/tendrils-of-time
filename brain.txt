What we have
a basic tree generator that works great for generating tree at various levels 
(lacks height, would be nice to have a length factor to make it grow more on the y-axis instead of x-axis)

Attacker that can spawn in and be disabled/killed and respawned which gets a random leaf assigned
moves towards leaf and when at leaf, decreases that leafs hp, when leaf hp is zero it is "removed"

What we need
* Input from player to be able to defeat Attackers
* System where the water needs to be watered at intervals or top branches will fall off
* Input from player to be able to water the tree
* Some kind of UI to present when the tree needs water
* A ground for the tree to stand on
* Serializing/deserializing the tree on-load to disk
* Menu of some kind before the game + pause menu, use enum state design pattern for this keep it simple

Player:
Should be just a quad, perhaps the player is able to place ladders?
The ladders would allow the player to scale the tree vertically 

How is the player placing ladders?

Or perhaps the player is able to place small plattforms to climb on

In order to water the tree the player needs to climb down
